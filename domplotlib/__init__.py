	Save the given figure as an SVG.

	:param fname: The file to save the SVG as.
		If ``format`` is set, it determines the output format, and the file is saved as ``fname``.
		Note that ``fname`` is used verbatim, and there is no attempt to make the extension,
		if any, of ``fname`` match ``format``, and no extension is appended.

		If ``format`` is not set, then the format is inferred from the extension of ``fname``, if there is one.

	:param dpi: The resolution in dots per inch. If ``'figure'``, use the figure's dpi value.
	:param facecolor: The facecolor of the figure. If ``'auto'``, use the current figure facecolor.
	:param edgecolor: The edgecolor of the figure.  If ``'auto'``, use the current figure edgecolor.
	:param orientation: Currently only supported by the postscript backend.

	:param transparent: If :py:obj:`True`, the axes patches will all be transparent;
			the figure patch will also be transparent unless ``facecolor`` and/or ``edgecolor`` are specified.
			This is useful, for example, for displaying a plot on top of a colored background on a web page.
			The transparency of these patches will be restored to their original values upon exit of this function.

	:param bbox_inches: str or `.Bbox`, default: :rc:`savefig.bbox`
			Bounding box in inches: only the given portion of the figure is
			saved.  If 'tight', try to figure out the tight bbox of the figure.

	:param pad_inches: float, default: :rc:`savefig.pad_inches`
			Amount of padding around the figure when bbox_inches is 'tight'.
